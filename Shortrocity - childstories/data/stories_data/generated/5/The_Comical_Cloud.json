His constant companions: Breezy the Wind (transparent with swirling patterns, always shifting around Nimbus), and the Raindrop Twins (shimmering clear drops with playful expressions) drift nearby. Nimbus shapes himself into a laughing giraffe, bringing smiles to the children below. The bright sunlight casts soft shadows, creating a lively and magical atmosphere. Gentle breezes carry the giggles that Nimbus emits as he moves."
