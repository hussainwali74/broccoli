His constant companions: Whisper the Owl (snow-white feathers, golden monocle, perched on his usual branch), and the Harmony Hares (matching grey twins with blue ribbons) sit in their regular spots. Max conducts tonight's symphony, his antlers catching the golden sunset light that streams through the consistent line of ancient pine trees framing the background. The wind chimes on his antlers create their signature tinkling melody as he moves."
