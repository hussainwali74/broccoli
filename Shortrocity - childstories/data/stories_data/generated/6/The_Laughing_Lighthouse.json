        "description": "Jack (seven years old, four feet tall, sturdy build, short brown hair with a green cap, bright blue eyes, wearing a yellow raincoat and rubber boots) stands at the base of the Laughing Lighthouse (tall and white with red stripes, large circular windows, a friendly face carved into the door), which emits funny light patterns that dance across the sea. The rocky shore remains consistent with its colorful seashells and smooth stones under a clear blue sky. The late morning sun casts a bright and cheerful light over the scene. Playful light patterns and sparkling effects emanate from the lighthouse, enhancing its magical presence. The camera captures a medium-wide shot, focusing on Jack and the Laughing Lighthouse."
