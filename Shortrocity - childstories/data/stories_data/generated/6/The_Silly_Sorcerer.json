Mia looks excited as she prepares to assist Simon with his magical experiments. The workshop maintains its consistent whimsical decor with vibrant colors and magical elements. The morning sunlight streams through stained glass windows, casting colorful patterns inside. Magical sparkles and effervescent bubbles enhance the enchanted atmosphere. The camera captures a wide-angle shot, showcasing both Mia and Simon in their magical workspace."

Mia imitates Simon's wand movements, both looking determined yet slightly clumsy. The whimsical workshop provides a consistent environment with bubbling potions and floating ingredients. The bright midday sun illuminates the scene with a sparkling ambiance. Magical sparks and floating symbols appear as they cast the spell. The scene is captured from a slightly elevated angle, focusing on their coordinated efforts."
