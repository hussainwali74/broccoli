      "description": "Jester the Jellyfish (graceful tentacles with luminescent blue and purple hues, translucent body with shimmering spots, always waves merrily, emits a soft glow in the dark, fluid and graceful movements) drifts playfully near the Coral Reef. His constant companion: Coral the Seahorse (small with vibrant orange stripes, curly tail, elegant fins, always carries a tiny seashell, gentle and graceful) swims alongside him. The underwater world is teeming with colorful corals, swaying sea plants, and sparkling bubbles under a clear aquamarine sky. Jester begins to laugh melodiously, his tentacles creating beautiful patterns of light in the water. Sunlight filters through the waves, casting radiant reflections and soft shadows. Magical sparkles float around Jester, and the scene is captured from a dynamic underwater angle, emphasizing the fluid motion."

The setting sun casts a soft golden glow over the Coral Reef, with tiny bubbles beginning to rise. Gentle currents create soft waves, and the water is filled with a magical twilight atmosphere. Sparkles surround Luna as she poses her riddle, viewed from a low angle to emphasize the elegant jellyfish."
