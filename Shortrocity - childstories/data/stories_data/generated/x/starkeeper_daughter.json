      "description": "A small attic bedroom with walls covered in star charts and constellation maps. A young girl with vitiligo that looks like star patterns on her skin stands at a window seat, holding a peculiar jar that glows with captured starlight. Her mother's astronomy equipment lies scattered around - telescopes, star wheels, and notebooks filled with celestial calculations. Most striking is a massive mobile hanging from the ceiling, made of hundreds of tiny jars, each containing a fallen star at a different stage of brightness. The stars cast moving shadows that tell stories on the walls, and some jars hold constellations in miniature."

      "description": "An ethereal nighttime scene on a hospital rooftop. Luna stands with her collection jars while shooting stars fall like tears from the sky. Each star has a distinct color and leaves a trail of cosmic dust. The stars appear to be drawn to Luna's vitiligo patterns, which glow in response. Her mother's old star-catching net, woven from moonbeams and aurora lights, shimmers in her hands. Medical equipment visible through a nearby window transforms into celestial instruments under the starlight. A constellation that looks exactly like her mother's face shimmers briefly in the sky."

      "description": "A detailed scene inside one of the star jars. The captured star reveals memories within its light: Luna's mother teaching her about constellations, their midnight picnics during meteor showers, the way her mother's laugh would make the northern lights dance. The memories swirl like cosmic dust, each one preserved in perfect detail. The glass of the jar is etched with astronomical formulae that pulse with starlight, and tiny nebulae form in the corners like cotton candy made of light. Luna's reflection in the glass shows both her present self and a younger version, sitting on her mother's lap at an observatory."

      "description": "A poignant scene in the hospital room transformed by starlight. Hundreds of captured stars in their jars create a miniature universe around her mother's bed. Medical monitors display constellation patterns instead of vital signs, and IV tubes glow like rivers of stardust. The stars project their stories onto the ceiling - a cosmic cinema of shared memories. Luna carefully arranges the brightest stars near her mother's pillow, their light gentle enough to soothe but strong enough to fight back the darkness. Through the window, real stars in the sky seem to bend toward the room, as if watching over one of their own."

      "description": "An intimate moment of cosmic connection. As Luna holds her mother's hand, their joined fingers create constellation patterns in the air. The star jars around them pulse in rhythm with both their heartbeats. Tiny astronomical phenomena occur in the space between them - miniature galaxies spiral in their shared tears, and aurora lights dance in the folds of the hospital blanket. The vitiligo patterns on Luna's skin map out new constellations that match the ones in her mother's eyes. A particularly bright star in a jar near the bed splits into two, suggesting the unbreakable connection between mother and daughter."

      "description": "A transcendent scene of celestial healing. The star jars release their light in a gentle cascade, creating a luminous bridge between earth and sky. Luna's mother floats slightly above her bed, surrounded by constellations that look like embracing arms. The vitiligo patterns on Luna's skin release their own stored starlight, revealing that she has been collecting light within herself all along. Medical equipment dissolves into stardust, and the hospital walls become transparent, showing the vast cosmic dance beyond. Mother and daughter are enveloped in a cocoon of stellar light, their shadows on the wall merging into a single constellation that tells their story to the watching universe."

      "content": "In the end, Luna realized that being a Star Keeper wasn't just about catching falling stars - it was about keeping hope alive in the darkest of nights. And even when some stars fade, their light lives on in the hearts of those who loved them enough to catch them when they fell."
