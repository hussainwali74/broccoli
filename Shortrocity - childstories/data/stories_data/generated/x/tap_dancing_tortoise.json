      "description": "A lush garden where Timmy the tortoise taps rhythms with his shell against different surfaces, creating a variety of musical sounds. His slow but steady movements allow for precise and intricate tap routines. Each step creates a unique musical note as his shell and feet connect with various natural surfaces - hollow logs, smooth stones, and wooden planks."
