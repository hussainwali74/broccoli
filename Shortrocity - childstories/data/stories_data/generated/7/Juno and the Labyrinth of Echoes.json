      "description": "Juno (five years old, average height with a sturdy build, tousled brown hair with a hint of red, freckles across his cheeks, always wears a green cap with a blue band, bright curious eyes, often found with a flashlight) stands before the entrance of an ancient labyrinth made of towering stone walls covered in intricate carvings. Accompanied by his friend Tiko the turtle (green shell with intricate patterns, slow-moving, wise eyes, wears a small explorer's hat), Juno takes his first steps into the maze. The walls loom high above, casting deep shadows on the ground. Vines and moss cover the stone, adding to the mysterious atmosphere. The late afternoon sun casts long shadows, enhancing the labyrinth's enigmatic presence. The camera captures Juno's determined expression as he begins his quest."
