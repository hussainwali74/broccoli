      "description": "A whimsical and colorful illustration of a mysterious greenhouse, constructed entirely of stained glass panels, each depicting a meaningful moment in Sarah and Mama's lives, forming a kaleidoscope of remembrance. In the center, Sarah, a young girl of around 10, with curly chestnut brown hair, big hazel eyes, and lightly freckled cheeks, is wearing a soft floral-patterned dress and worn gardening boots as she tends to remarkable flowers. These include vibrant roses with moving pictures, sunflowers whose petals are infused with preserved laughter, and glowing lilies that emanate the light of past birthdays. Nearby, Mama's empty gardening chair, adorned with a well-loved sunhat, quietly sparkles with forgotten memories that filter through its weave. The air is filled with soft, glowing memory-pollen, floating around and creating miniature scenes wherever it lands, enhancing the enchanting atmosphere of the greenhouse."

The greenhouse walls echo these memory-flowers infinitely, revealing a vibrant, endless garden of preserved time, bathed in the warm, golden hues of sunlight filtering through the glass, creating a whimsical and colorful ambiance."

They flit between the flowers, facilitating their cross-pollination and giving rise to extraordinary hybrid blooms. One flower merges images of Mama teaching Sarah to bake with another depicting them dancing together in the kitchen, resulting in a new plant that exudes nostalgic scents of vanilla and bright, twinkling music. Time-bee pollinators, adorned with clock face wings, observe this magical exchange, assuring the cherished memories are maintained within the garden's organized layout, all while the scene is wrapped in a whimsical and colorful atmosphere."
