      "description": "A mystical nighttime garden scene with vibrant flowers glowing softly in bioluminescent light. The garden contains unusual plants, such as sparkling crystal-like roses and floating tulips. Luna, a curious 7-year-old girl with short curly brown hair adorned with a pink bow, stands at an ornate gate covered in phosphorescent vines. She wears a cozy, oversized yellow sweater and denim shorts, holding a magical brass key that sparkles like a treasure. The sky is a deep indigo, dotted with stars and a large moon that has a gentle, sleepy face. The atmosphere is enchanting yet serene. The image style is illustrative fantasy with a soft color palette and ethereal lighting, reminiscent of a children's storybook."
