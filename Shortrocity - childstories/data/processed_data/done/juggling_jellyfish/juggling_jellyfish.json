      "description": "A whimsical and colorful underwater illustration, reminiscent of a vibrant animated film, featuring Jazz, a small, translucent jellyfish with a bulbous dome shape. He uses his long, delicate tentacles to juggle bioluminescent orbs that shimmer with blues and greens as they arc through the water. Jazz's bell pulses with hues of light blue and soft lavender, creating a natural light show. The orbs leave trailing patterns of light, forming intricate geometric designs. Various sea creatures gather around him, their eyes reflecting the colorful display, and the soft sunlight filters down, illuminating the scene."
