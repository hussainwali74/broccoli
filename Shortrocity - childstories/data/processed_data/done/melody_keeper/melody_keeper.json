A young boy, Marcus, stands before an ancient piano with crystallized memory keys shimmering softly in the golden light.

The walls are adorned with ethereal instruments, whispering soft melodies, and a massive musical staff wraps around the room, shifting gently with the flow of different songs, casting a warm, inviting ambiance throughout the scene."
