He wears a tiny top hat made from a desert flower, which sits jauntily on his head. In his front paw, he holds a slender wand crafted from a polished stick. Surrounding him, his audience of meerkats sits on naturally terraced rock formations, their eyes wide with wonder. Fireflies and desert moths flit around, casting magical lighting effects that twinkle around the stage."
