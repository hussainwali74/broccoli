    "description": "Max the Moose (seven feet tall at the shoulder, chocolate-brown fur with silver-tipped edges, majestic antlers decorated with permanent silver wind chimes, gentle brown eyes behind half-moon spectacles, signature blue bowtie with white musical notes) stands in his familiar forest clearing. His constant companions: Whisper the Owl (snow-white feathers, golden monocle, perched on his usual branch), and the Harmony Hares (matching grey twins with blue ribbons) sit in their regular spots. Max conducts tonight's symphony, his antlers catching the golden sunset light that streams through the consistent line of ancient pine trees framing the background. The wind chimes on his antlers create their signature tinkling melody as he moves."
